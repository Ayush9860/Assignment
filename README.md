# Assignment
The assignment has 4 different operations as follows : 
  1. Binary-Search => implementation of the binary search algorithm to search for a
           specific element in a sorted array. The program should allow the user to input a
           target element and then search for that element in the sorted array. It should
           return the index of the element if found or indicate that the element is not in
           the array.
  2. Email-Sender => programmatically trigger an email.
  3. Palindrome-Checker => check whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A
           palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence of characters that reads the same
           backwards as forward.
  4. String-Manipulator => take a sentence as input and performs the following
           operations:
              i. Count the number of words in the sentence.
              ii. Reverse the order of words in the sentence.
              iii. Replace all spaces with hyphens ('-').
